    "Paris, capital of France, is one of the most important and influential cities in the world. In terms of tourism, Paris is the second most visited city in Europe. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to provide potential investors the best decisions possible to open a hotel in Paris, France. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Paris, like in the most of the western big cities of Europe, the coronavirus(Covid-19) has a significant impact on tourism market or real estate & property market, but despite this situation, a large number of firms & their analysts believe that the tourism market could make a recovery by 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding our project, to make an optimal recommendation for the site selection for a hotel, we will explore and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does location influence to open an hotel property ? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. How close it is the potential location to the top attractions? \n",
    "\n",
    "The secondary criteria for the site selection will be also the availability of restaurants, bars and accessibility to public transport and parking\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use our data science knowledge using Machine Learning to generate the best option of district based on these criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve this business problem, we will cluster the Paris areas based on the distance to the attractions and the amenities, i.e. transport, restaurants, bars. We will then compare these clusters with the average for each cluster. This will provide valuable information on whether a location is a viable choice for investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.\n",
